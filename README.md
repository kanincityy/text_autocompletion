# Character-Level Text Auto-Completion with LSTMs

This repository contains the implementation for a project focused on predicting the next three characters in a text sequence using a Recurrent Neural Network (specifically, an LSTM). The goal was to build a model capable of tasks similar to text-editing auto-suggestions (e.g., "Merry Christ‚Ä¶" -> "mas").

This project was completed as part of my MSc in Language Sciences coursework at UCL.

### üéØ Project Goal (Based on Assessment Brief)

*   Build a deep learning model (LSTM) to predict the next three characters given a preceding text sequence.
*   Train the model exclusively on a provided dataset of seven ebooks from Project Gutenberg.
*   Preprocess the text data and create appropriate training and test sets.
*   Implement the model training and evaluation pipeline.
*   Discuss model architecture choices, parameter selection, and potential improvements.

### ‚ú® Key Features & Implementation Details

*   **Data Loading & Preprocessing:** Scripts to load and clean text data from the provided ebook sources.
*   **Model Architecture:** Implementation of a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network suitable for character-level sequence prediction.
*   **Dataset Handling:** Utilises a custom PyTorch `Dataset` class for efficient data loading and batching during training. 
*   **Training Pipeline:** Includes code for training the LSTM model with PyTorch `Trainer` class, monitoring loss, and evaluating performance. 
*   **Hyperparameter Exploration:** Includes analysis/discussion regarding the choice of hyperparameters (e.g., embedding size, hidden units, learning rate).

### üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

*   **Core Libraries:** Python, PyTorch, NumPy, NLTK 
*   **Environment:** Google Colaboratory
